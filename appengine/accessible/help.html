    <h1>Accessible Blockly Music Game: Help</h1>

    <p>
      Accessible Blockly is a version of Blockly designed for use with
      screen readers. It consists of two sections: a toolbox and a workspace.
      You can move toolbox from the workspace, and join them to create
      programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of the workspace as a playground containing various groups of
      blocks. You can use Tab or Shift-Tab to navigate between these groups, as
      well as to get to the toolbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you're on a block, you can press the up or down arrow keys to go to
      the next or previous block in the group. You can also use the right arrow
      key to access the block's submenus, which will allow you to modify its
      inputs, or do other things like copying, moving or deleting the block.
      You can move blocks by copying them to the clipboard and pasting them
      on the workspace, or by marking the destination spot and then copying or
      moving the block to that marked spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of each level in the game game, you'll want to end up with a
      single group in the workspace that forms a program. When the program is
      run, it should satisfy the instructions given for that level. You'll be
      able to run the program, listen to the music you make, and adjust your
      program if needed.
