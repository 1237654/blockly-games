    <h1>Accessible Blockly Music Game: Help</h1>

    <p>
      Accessible Blockly is a version of Blockly designed for use with
      screen readers. It consists of two sections: a toolbox and a workspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The workspace can contain various groups of blocks; use Tab or Shift-Tab
      to navigate between these groups. On individual blocks, you can press up
      or down to go to the next or previous block. You can also move right to
      access the block's submenu, which allows you to modify the block's
      inputs, or cut, copy, move or delete the block. It is also possible to
      mark the destination spot for a block and then move the block to the
      marked spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      To complete a level, create a single group of blocks in the workspace
      that satisfies the instructions. When this group of blocks is run as a
      program, you'll be able to listen to the music you've made, and adjust
      the program as needed.
